## üì• **Installation**

1. Download and install [Installer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1129665658968354909/1166251568161624074/Symphony_Installer_1.0.apk?ex=6549cf69&is=65375a69&hm=f064cf892f4aa515ebcf1fe6c37ee878db3a6886ce38f4e58ae400dac54ce735&) from latest release


2. Open the newly installed "Symphony Installer" app from your app drawer
    
3. Now press install in the installer

4. Wait for the download to finish

5. Go in to downloads in your files and find Download folder inside it and then install symphony apk


6. If Google Play warns you about this application being unverified, ignore it. This happens because Aliucord is built & signed locally on your device so Play Protect doesn't recognise the signature¬π

*The process takes around 10 min depending on your internet*

*if you'd like, you can disable this warning by turning off Play Protect in Google Play's settings, play protect is useless.
Play Protect can be turned off by tapping on your user icon in the top right of Google Play, tapping on "Play Protect," tapping on the cog icon in the top right, and finally toggling "Scan apps with Play Protect" to off. This may result in Google Play "nagging" you to re-enable it sometimes when sideloading apps.*
## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

- Try closing and then reopening symphony 

- Double check that symphony has permission to access files

- Reinstall Aliucord using the installer
